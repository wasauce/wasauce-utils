wasauce-utils

This is a collection of python scripts that I commonly use in projects. The point of this project is to build a collection of libraries that anyone can use for future projects.

Utils:

-- google_contacts_util -- This util helps one pull Google Contacts from an authenticated user. 

-- twillio_sms_util -- This util provides the functionality to send SMS via Twillio.

-- salted_password_util -- This util provides a means of properly salting a password for storage.
